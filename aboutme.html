    <p>I had been called to Maasai Mara University
      to pursue a course in Barchelor of Science in Information Science.
    I was supposed to join  the previous month but things never went so.
    well I had consulted a certain teacher of mine at high school about the course
    I was supposed to take in Maasai Mara and he advised me to combine my course with IT.
    Since i had done computer basics and I had some knowledge,i convinced my mind
    that I will do IT immediately I finish my university studies .Well my documents got lost and
    all the money we had saved for joining university.I became so frustrated and
    asked God many questions.God opened another way.Shofco called me for an IT
    interview and I passed.That's how I came in Moringa.I really thank God for thos
    very precious opportunity. </p>
